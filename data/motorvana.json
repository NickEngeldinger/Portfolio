{"title":"Motorvana","solutions":[{"problem":{"copy":"Maintenance and small changes to the site were extremely difficult to implement. The site's html was rendered line by line in Pearl print statements and the styling was a combination of deprecated html tags and inline css.","caption":"The original site had a stale look & feel","img":"/img/motorvana/idea-home.jpg"},"solution":{"copy":"I teamed with a backend programmer to implement a Django app, it gave him the flexibility to fix various database and 3rd party vendor integration issues while it afforded me a proper platform for the front end design. I took care of the routing and template creation as well as building out front end. ","caption":"The new site is clean & contemporary","img":"/img/motorvana/mv-home.jpg"}},{"problem":{"copy":"The client came to us with a design that was sharp but not very well fleshed out, particularily for the number of user interactions in this type of site. The only direction included were a specfic scroll bar treatment and a set of button states.","caption":"There was a lot of room for improvement","img":"/img/motorvana/bad-ui.jpg"},"solution":{"copy":"Through a number of iterations with the client we ended up including some custom themed jQuery UI components (modals, slider inputs, accordians, edatpickers) as well as a few custom JS widgets (image gallery, distance calculator).","caption":"The color scheme adapted to various UI components","img":"/img/motorvana/btn-treatment.jpg"}},{"problem":{"copy":"Client needs to capture an estimate of the customer's proposed trip distance (in kilometers since the business environment is Canada) early in the booking process.","caption":"The original booking process was disjointed","img":"/img/motorvana/next-step.jpg"},"solution":{"copy":"I created a widget that asks the user for their beginning and end travel points and uses an AJAX call to Google Maps to calculate the distance, display a map of the route and enter that data into the appropriate field in the booking tool.","caption":"Google Maps JavaScript API does the work","img":"/img/motorvana/mileage.jpg"}},{"problem":{"copy":"The current design contains page upon page of checkboxes, with no useful form validation and the process to obtain an RV rental can be cumbersome which lead to customers abandoning the site prior to completing the booking process.","caption":"Make a mistake & you'll be forwarded to the error page","img":"/img/motorvana/form-handling.jpg"},"solution":{"copy":"Multi-state modal windows gave me the ability to concisely present each of the steps in a particular section of the booking process. Trip options, vehicle options, booking and payment options, were all honed to create a logical and engaging experience for the user. I also utilized Django's built in form validation and modified the output to suit the design.","caption":"Errors are now easy to identify and remedy","img":"/img/motorvana/form.jpg"}}]}
